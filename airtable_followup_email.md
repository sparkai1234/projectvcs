**Subject:** Re: API Pagination Issue - Case #01025088 - Technical Issue NOT Resolved by Standard Guidelines

---

Dear Airtable Support Team,

Thank you for your response (Case #01025088). I appreciate the standard pagination guidelines you provided, however, **I am already implementing all of these correctly** as documented in my original email with technical evidence.

## **Issue Still NOT Resolved**

Your response suggests I may not be handling pagination properly, but my original email included **detailed technical evidence** proving that:

✅ **Pagination Implementation**: I AM using offset parameters correctly  
✅ **API Call Limits**: I AM well under the 100,000/month limit (Team Plan)  
✅ **Record Limits**: My 17,007 records ARE under the 50,000 limit (Team Plan)  
✅ **Request Logic**: I AM handling responses correctly  

## **The Core Technical Issue You Missed**

**The API is NOT returning offset tokens after page 2, despite having 16,807 more records to retrieve.**

### **Specific Evidence (from my original email):**
```
Request 1: GET /v0/apptH56xIB43Cf2r8/tbl6FcXjgBqyHciOD?maxRecords=100
✅ Response: 100 records + offset token

Request 2: GET /v0/apptH56xIB43Cf2r8/tbl6FcXjgBqyHciOD?maxRecords=100&offset={token}
❌ Response: 100 records + NO offset token (should have 16,707 more!)
```

### **This is NOT a pagination implementation issue - this is an API bug:**
- ✅ Interface shows: 17,007 records
- ❌ API returns: Only 200 records maximum
- ❌ API stops pagination prematurely without valid reason

## **Evidence I Already Provided**

In my original email, I included:
1. **Code samples** showing correct pagination implementation
2. **API response logs** proving the offset stops working
3. **Interface screenshots** showing all 17,007 records exist
4. **Rate limit verification** confirming no violations
5. **Account verification** confirming Team Plan permissions

## **This Requires Technical Investigation**

Since this issue **contradicts your own API documentation** and **cannot be resolved by following standard guidelines**, I need:

1. **Technical team escalation** - not generic pagination advice
2. **API server logs** investigation for base `apptH56xIB43Cf2r8`
3. **Bug confirmation** - why does pagination stop at 200 records?
4. **Timeline for resolution** - this is blocking critical business operations

## **Request for Proper Support**

Please escalate this to your **technical/engineering team** who can:
- Investigate the actual API behavior for my specific base
- Explain why offset tokens stop being returned after 200 records
- Provide a timeline for fixing this apparent API bug

**This is not a "how to use pagination" issue - this is a "your API is not working as documented" issue.**

I have provided comprehensive technical evidence that I am following all guidelines correctly. The issue is on Airtable's end, not mine.

## **Business Impact Reminder**
This is preventing a critical VC intelligence system from accessing 98.8% of the required data (16,807 out of 17,007 records), causing significant business disruption.

Please provide a technical solution or escalate to someone who can investigate the actual API server behavior.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent technical matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

**P.S.** I can provide additional API logs, screen recordings, or direct access to demonstrate this issue if your technical team needs it.
