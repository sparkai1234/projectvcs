### ⚠️ **One Remaining Issue**: Financial Statements Pagination Timeout

- **Root Cause**: Financial statements have the largest dataset
- **Impact**: First page data collected successfully, pagination times out
- **Solution Applied**: Reduced to 10 pages max, 8-second delays, error handling

## 🚀 **Deployment Optimizations Applied**

### **Final Financial Statements Optimization:**
```javascript
// Conservative settings for financial statements
const financialConfig = { 
    maxPages: 10,      // Reduced from 50 to 10
    delay: 8000        // Increased to 8 seconds
};

// Graceful error handling
try {
    await handlePaginationWrapper(page, financialConfig, 'financial_statements', supabase);
} catch (paginationError) {
    console.log('⚠️ Financial statements pagination failed, but first page data was collected');
}
```
