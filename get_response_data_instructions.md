# 🎯 How to Get Response Data from DevTools

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **In Network Tab**
- Click on `DivHrmMnpwringInq` request (the one showing in your list)
- This will open the request details panel on the right

### 2. **Click Response Tab**
You'll see tabs like:
- Headers
- **Response** ← Click this one!
- Cookies  
- Timing

### 3. **Copy the JSON Data**
The Response tab will show JSON like:
```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "companyName": "성남벤처투자",
      "investments": 11,
      "preConversion": 6,
      "currentBalance": 6,
      "management": 5
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 4. **What to Look For**
The JSON should contain:
- Company names (회사명)
- Investment counts (출자금)  
- Portfolio data (전환전액, 투자잔액)
- Management info (경영관리)

### 5. **Copy Everything**
Select all the JSON data and paste it here!

## 🚀 Why This Matters

With this JSON structure, I can:
1. **Build exact API calls** that match the DIVA system
2. **Parse data correctly** with proper field mapping
3. **Handle pagination** and filtering
4. **Upload to Airtable** with perfect structure
5. **Create automated updates** for your VC portal

## 📋 Alternative if JSON not visible:
If you don't see JSON, try:
1. Click "Preview" tab instead of Response
2. Look for XHR requests (not just script/image files)
3. Try refreshing the page with Network tab open
4. Click the search button while watching Network tab
